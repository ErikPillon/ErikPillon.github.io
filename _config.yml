  Hi, my name's Erik and I'm a PhD Student in theoretical and computational physics @ University of Luxembourg. 
  My scientific activity ranges from the field of Chemical Physics to Electrodynamics; 
  in particular I'm involved in the development of efficient numerical methods for the modelization of the (molecular) 
  Aharonov-Bohm effect in molecules and crystals with mathematically rigorous treatments. My other scientific interests 
  cover the development and improvements of Machine Learning techniques for the prediction of molecular and chemical properties.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>non-adiabatic dynamics</mark>, <mark>non-Abelian geometry</mark>, efficient and parallelized <mark>numerical techniques</mark> for quantum systems.
  
  **Achievements**:
  - Physics olympiads team (highschool) 
  - Mathematical Games ("Giochi matematici") competition (middle school)
  - I'm a self taught html coder: this website,for example, has been created by myself with jekyll and this (adapted) package.
  - Top 4% users of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). If you're a member as well and would like to get in contact, kere's my own key <code>1651656_Iz5GGTJixRj9kIs1XWypzgi8xs14opse</code>
  - I like to create and share pop-science contents: checkout the projects I'm involved [Phi6 Passion](https://www.facebook.com/Phi6Passion), [La Gaia Scienza](https://www.facebook.com/LaGaiaScienzaF) (Italian only) 
    and [Mathone](https://www.facebook.com/math0ne) (mainly Italian)
