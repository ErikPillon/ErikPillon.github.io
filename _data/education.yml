    During the period I spent in Grenoble I got the opportunity of exiting from my comfort zone and learn from a completely new environment.
    I studied 5 months in Grenoble INP focusing on Physics curses and, in the last 6 months, I developed my Master Thesis at Insitut NÃ©el.

    Relevant courses include Advanced Numerical Analysis, Differential Geometry and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations.

    I partially paid my studies in this period as teaching assistant of the courses Analysis II and Time Series Analysis (both for Bachelor Students).
    Alongside my studies I've been Representative Student (second time)  and I've been one of the organizers of the end year event [Festascienze](www.festascienzeunivr.it)(second time).

    The Summer School was intended as an advanced undergraduate course in thermal and statistical
    physics, quantum mechanics and electrodynamics. The final project consisted in an estimate of electric
    and magnetic fields generated by heavy-ion collisions. In this work we derived analytic formula for electric and magnetic fields produced by a moving charged
    particle in a conducting medium with the electric conductivity.
