  Hi, my name's Erik and I'm a PhD Student in theoretical and computational physics. 
  My scientific activity ranges from the field of Chemical Physics to Electrodynamics; 
  in particular I'm trying to develop efficient numerical methods for the modelization of the (molecular) Aharonov-Bohm effect in molecules and crystals with mathematically rigorous treatments. 

  I am most skilled in: <mark>non-adiabatic dynamics</mark> and <mark>non-Abelian treatments</mark> of quantum mechanics.
  
  In my free time I like to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/91605767-erik-pillon?shelf=read) and watch Formula 1/MotoGP.

  Alongside my interests in physics and science outreaching some of my other interests and hobbies are:
   - Formula 1/MotoGP and motorsports in general
   - Gaming
   - Stamps and coins collecting
   - Running and cycling
   - Playing chess  
  
  (Also) thanks to my experiences abroad, I had the opportunity of learning 
  some other languages apart from Italian; in particuar I have some knowledge in:
    - **Italian**: modertongue
    - **English**: fluent
    - **French**: fluent (those accents still confuse me a lot though ;) )
    - **German**: ständige persönliche Herausforderung
    - **Spanish**: lo entiendo cuando me hablan ma non lo hablo fluentemente...
